Welcome to the "Foundations of HPC" course at DSSC Department of the University of Trieste.

The scope of the course is to give you:

- an introduction to basic concepts of the High Performance Computing
- an introduction to the modern computer architecture and the techniques to exploit it to maximize performance
- an introduction to parallel/multi-threading programming with MPI and OpenMP
- an introduction to basic and advanced techniques for code optimisation for single- and multi-threaded codes

### Lectures

There will be 77 hours of lectures, on Monday and Friday, in "Aula D" in the basement of SISSA Building, at the Miramare campus.
The lectures will be structured as follows:

|        | 9.30-11.00 | 11.00-11.30 | 11.30-13.00 | 14.30-15.30 | 15.30-17.30                       |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Monday | first part | break       | second part | exercises   | free exercises + Office Hours (*) |
| Friday | first part | break       | second part | --          | --                                |

(*) *both S. Cozzini and L. Tornatore will be in Aula D for counselling, questions and chats about the course topics*

The lectures will be held starting from Friday 11th, October.
In the following days the lessons will be suspended:
Nov, 1st; Dec, 20th. 

After the Christmas break the lectures will re-start on Friday, 10th Jan and will end on Friday, 17th Jan.


### Exam

The final mark will be made up by the weighted sum of the marks obtained in home assignments that will be given along the course, and of the mark obtained in a final written test.
The marks range from 0 to 30, 18 being the minimum to pass (all the marks must be at minimum 18).


#### ASSIGNEMENTS:
3 written exercises will be assigned, with a strict due date. Failing to submit the solutions, unless for serious reasons of non-academic nature, will deny the access to the final exam.

70% if the final mark will be calculated from the exercises' marks, as detailed here after.
The assignments's schedule will be the following:

- Oct, 28th --> due date: Nov, 4th     [ 20% of the final mark ]
- Nov, 29th --> due date: Dec, 16th    [ 30% of the final mark ]
- Dec, 16th --> due date: Jan, 10th    [ 20% of the final mark ]


#### FINAL TEST:
The final written test will consist in about 15 questions covering all the topics mentioned during the lectures. The corresponding mark will weight 30% of the final mark.

In case you wanted to improve your final mark, you could ask for an oral examination. That is at your own risk. Normally, if your oral examination goes through smoothly, you will only improve your result and you won't achieve a mark lower than what you already had.
However, should you perform terribly, convincing us that your previous marks were not really related to your personal work, your mark could be put at risk.
